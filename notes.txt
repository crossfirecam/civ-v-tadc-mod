Playtesting Todo
- Ensure that weird 'settler getting all promotions' bug is not my fault, by starting 30 games with no other mods installed.
- Ensure that all Civlopedia text is present.
- Ensure that Civs aren't poorly balanced in actual gameplay.
- What music plays for the 4 Civs? I can't figure out how to set this, it may be <ArtDefineTag> in <Civilizations>
