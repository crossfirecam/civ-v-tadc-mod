# civ-v-tadc-mod
A mod for Civilization V: BNW. Aims to add 4 Civilizations to the game based on The Amazing Digital Circus.

## Info about mod creation process
- Requires the use of the Modbuddy tool
- Each time the mod is built in Modbuddy:
    - Ensure Civ V is open. The game needn't be opened/closed for every build
    - Load log files under 'My Games/Sid Mier's Civilization V/logs': Database.log & xml.log
    - In Civ V click 'Mods', 'Agree', and select our mod.
    - In the log files, scroll to the final line. In Civ V, load our mod. Any errors (which are not Firaxis' default errors) should be noted.
